								<h1 class="major">Factors By Phases</h1>
								<p>Building a website involves several phases, and the time aspect of each stage will depend on your business requirements, the complexity of the project, which in turn influences the price.</p>
								</br>
								<h3>User Interface and User Experience Design - UI/UX</h3>
								<p>A stunning website design spells the success of the product/service. In short, UI/UX design plays a very crucial role in the success of your website.</p>
								<p>What does it take to design an attractive website to impress your potential customers? The stages involved in this process, include:</br>

								Researching</br>
								Wireframing</br>
									UI/UX designing</br></p>
								<p>To sum up, the UI/UX phase might take an average of one to two weeks, and cost $750-$4,000 and more. The time would vary depending on the project's requirements and complexity.</p>
								<table>
									<thead>
									<tr>
										<th>Time (Weeks)</th>
										<th>Cost ($)</th>
									</tr>
									</thead>
									<tbody>
									<tr>
										<td>1 ~ 2</td>

										<td>750 ~ 4,000</td>
									</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>
									</br>
									</br>

								<h3>Front-End Development</h3>
								<p>The front-end is the interface and first visual touch-point that website visitors recognize. The phase starts with the design and moves on to QA testing.</p>

									<p>The influencing cost factors in this phase include website responsiveness and the complexity of animations.</p>

									<p>To sum up, the front-end development phase might take an average of three to eight weeks, and cost $1,000-$12,500 and more.</p>
								<table>
									<thead>
									<tr>
										<th>Time (Weeks)</th>
										<th>Cost ($)</th>
									</tr>
									</thead>
									<tbody>
									<tr>
										<td>2 ~ 6</td>

										<td>1,000 ~ 12,500</td>
									</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>
								</br>
								</br>

								<h3>Back-End Development</h3>
								<p>The back-end comes into play when the user has interacted with the visual website interface via buttons and more. The back-end or server-side is the core of any website and is responsible for smooth functioning.</p>

								<p>The main influencing cost factors for this phase include integration with third-party service, complex queries, data processing tasks, and more.</p>

								<p>To sum up, the front-end development phase might take an average of three to eight weeks, and cost $4,000-$12,500 and more.</p>
								<table>
									<thead>
									<tr>
										<th>Time (Weeks)</th>
										<th>Cost ($)</th>

									</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>
								</br>
								</br>

								<h3>Content Management Systems (CMS) Development</h3>
								<p>You might want to create, edit, and manage the website content every now and then. And, you don’t want to reach out to developers every time you want to make minor changes.</p>

									<p>Therefore, you need CMS software to perform all of the above tasks smoothly.</p>

									<p>You might come across some CMS engines like WordPress, Drupal, and Shopify. However, you will find them limited in their functionality though they are designed to cut on development hours and reduce the cost to build a website.</p>

									<p>It might take an average of three to eight weeks, and cost $3,000-$9,000 and more.</p>
								<table>

									<tr>
										<th>Time (Weeks)</th>
										<th>Cost ($)</th>
